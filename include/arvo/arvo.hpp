/*
 * arvo_c - a C version of program for calculation volume and surface of
 * molecule according to article Busa et. al.: ARVO: A Fortran package for
 * computing the solvent accessible surface area and the excluded volume of
 * overlapping spheres via analytic equations, Computer Physics Communications,
 * Vol. 165, Iss. 1, Pages 59-96.
 *
 * Author(s): Jan Busa Jr.
 * Institution: Academia Sinica
 * Version 2.0, 27.12.2011
 *
 * Version history:
 * V2.0 - program rewritten into C. Added dynamic allocation of memory, changed
 *        loading of molecules (using files generated by input_structure),
 *        changed NorthPoleTest to NorthPoleFix removing the necessity of using
 *        rotation of whole molecule (which is in some cases impossible).
 * V1.0 - initial version written in FORTRAN. Can by downloaded from
 *        http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADUL
 *
 * [Jose] Adapted by Jose MORAN, PhD student at CORIA laboratory in France
 * for soot nanoparticles simulations.
